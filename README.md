# Deep Learning (Neural Networks) Showcase

The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate a proficient understanding and application of Neural Networks.

Project Goals: Implement a neural network on a custom dataset following Tensorflow documentation tutorials. Emphasizing "rapid prototyping," evaluate two architectures with dynamically created model functions for hyperparameter grid search. 
Conduct an in-depth exploration of hyperparameters, particularly focusing on the impact of altering one parameter through a grid search. Investigate three key parameters (e.g., learning rate, batch size, drop_out). Introduce feature engineering to observe its effects on the model.

This project is centered around the Kaggle dataset titled "League of Legends Diamond Ranked Games (10 min)."
